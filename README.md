After building a few prjects with React.js, I decided to get familiar with Angular and Typescript.  It's a simple application where users can book appointment online, get a 
confirmation email and in email they get a link, which they can follow and cancel appointment if needed. I've also created an admin dashboard, which is protected for 
admin use only. Admin has all appointments conveniently displayed in a table, where he/she can also delete appointment or search for appointments by name or last name.

Tools and libraries:

* Angular
* Angular Powered Bootstrap
* Node.js
* Express.js
* Mongoose
* Nodemailer
* jsonwebtoken
* bcrypt // for hashing passwords to store in DB
